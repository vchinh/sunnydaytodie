####An interactive short story

(link: "Click here to start.")[==
The ceiling today looks just as white and cracked as yesterday. Or the day before. Or the day before that.

For as long as she has been laying prone here - how many days has it been again? - it has always stayed the same, with that damp spot getting dangerously moister, but never so much that it starts leaking.

(link: "(Look at the window)")[==
Today is a sunny day. She can tell from the window at the far corner of the room. From the bed to there is about four steps, maybe three if she makes large strides. But even that much effort seems so far out of her reach now. She wonders if the trees have started sprouting greens. If seagulls have resumed their aggressive scavenging. If the sky has returned to its colour of endless azure.

(more:)[==There is enough energy in her to turn her head to the nightstand. One bottle of Ambien, open bracket, Zolpidem Tartrate, close bracket, ten milligrams, one hundred tablets. Do not refill. She mentally counts from what she can see from outside the transparent encasing. Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five, thirty, thirty-five, forty. Not to mention the ones on the other side she couldn't see. At the very least, it should be two times forty. It isn't exact math, but she's had this bottle for about two weeks. So her very unscientific, very uninspired calculations shouldn't be too far off the mark.

Her brother took fifty pills and he ended up brain dead. Less than an animal, more than a vegetable. In limbo, forever - or at least until someone takes pity on him. 

Who will take pity on her?

On the table, her phone is buzzing. She thinks.

Her thumb is picking at her fingernails, she suddenly notices. Pieces of skin flakes fall on her face, like dust, like ash. She raises her fingers to her mouth and tastes them. Like salt.

She's so tired. Maybe sleeping will help. She shuts her eyes.

(link: '(Put the phone back on the table)')[==\
She puts the phone back on the table. Suddenly, she feels a sharp pain in her stomach. Like a stab wound. She doubles over, clutching her belly. She realises she's making retching noises.

Maybe the vision she saw earlier was actually her, grabbing the bottle, swallowing the content whole. She turns to look at the table. The bottle is not there.

She falls down on the bed.

(link: '(The phone is ringing)')[==
The phone's buzzing feels like a drill straight inside her skull, tearing apart her brain, yanking her out of blissful oblivion.

She knows the number by heart. Of course, it's him.

It is all she could manage to press the little green button with her shaking hands.

"Your uncle called me."

"So he did."

"I'm driving over there, but is it too late?"

Just when the shrill ringing becomes unbearable, it stops. She sighs in relief. (set: $phone to "on table")]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Smash it against the wall" tags="" position="526,172.5" size="100,100">(replace: ?choice2)[==
The shrill ringing of the phone pierce her ear drums, cracking her skull wide open. Shut up, shut up, shut up!, her brain shouts. In a sudden surge of energy, she reaches out to grab the offending device, and throws it against the plain white sickening wall.
The phone shatters into millions of pieces, with it, the noise, and whoever was trying to reach out to her.

All of a sudden, she realises she's sitting up now. In front of her, the sleeping pills bottle.

Her hand grabs it, and she can't believe how easy the action is. She watches as her fingers twist opens the bottle, pouring out some into her palm, and from her palm in her mouth. Her throat works to swallow them as her saliva struggles to lubricate the dry pills, but they finally go down, down, down the long oesophagus tube. Encouraged, she takes more, and more, and more, until the whole bottle is empty.

It is done. She will die, and no one is there to stop her.

(link: '(Close eyes)')[==
She closes her eyes. The bright light of the sun beams into her eyelids, making her see red. The colour of her own blood.

It feels like centuries, but at long last, red fades to black.

She breathes out, for the last time.



''GAME OVER''

(link: 'Restart?')[(goto-url:'sunnyday.html')]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Keep sleeping" tags="" position="275,293.5" size="100,100">(set: $care to it + 1)(replace: ?choice3)[==
In her dream, she sees herself drenched in her own puddle of tears, she can't stop, she does not understand why. The puddle grows and grows until it becomes a sea, and suddenly she is literally drowning, and she flails and gasps and cries out for help but the salty liquid penetrates her, filling up her lungs, one wave after another, and her voice is smothered. She tries to shout for mommy, but she remembers that her mother is dead, and there is absolutely no one in the world now who would hear her, and that makes her sob even harder, even though all her mother would ever do was yell at her in a desperate attempt to make her stop. Her mother is dead, her brain reminds her again, and so is gone that last restraint tying her to this miserable, painful, hopeless, drowning world. 

As the dark waters of the sea pulls her asunder, she thinks of him and wishes he would be there to see her drown. Do you see how in pain I am right now, she would ask, have you seen what you've done, are you satisfied, does seeing me die hurt you, because I love to see you hurt, and she wants to crawl at her chest and rip off her lungs as it yearns for precious oxygen, god, it hurts so goddamn much-

(link: '(Wake)')[==
She wakes up with a jolt. The pillow underneath her head is damp.

Her eyes are opened, but she cannot see anything. Has she gone blind? For a split second, she feels an unimaginable surge of relief at that thought. But no - as her retina adjusts, she realises it's only night.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Wake up" tags="" position="404,290.5" size="100,100">(replace: ?choice3)[==
This time she wakes up, it is still as sunny as ever, but she is drowned in her own puddle of tears, she can't stop, she does not understand why. She yanks at her face to wipe the tears away, but the pressure on the lacrimal glands seem to induce the production of more liquid, one wave after another, and she suddenly remembers that her mother is dead. She is dead, and there is absolutely no one in the world now who cares if she cries or not, and that makes her cry even harder, even though all her mother would ever do was yell at her in a desperate attempt to make her stop. Her mother is dead, her brain reminds her again, and so is gone that last restraint tying her to this miserable, painful, hopeless, sunny world. Because even if her mother was useless, it's still her mother, and she doesn't want to be labelled a bad child for leaving the parent in mourning, so she sobs and sobs, and her phone is buzzing again she thinks, maybe she will pick it up this time and yell at his face: do you hear me crying now, do you see how in pain I am right now, have you seen what you've done, are you satisfied, does hearing me cry hurt you, because good, that's exactly what I want to do, and she suddenly has the urge to run into the kitchen and stab her own chest with a knife because it hurts so goddamn much-

(link: '(Do it)')[==
But she is too weak, and all she can do is sob and sob and sob until everything inside her is utterly drained, and the sun finally leaves her alone to drown in the deep cold darkness of the night.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Don&#39;t grab the bottle" tags="" position="276,405.5" size="100,100">(set: $care to it + 1)(replace: ?choice4)[==

She sees as her throat works to swallow them as her saliva struggles to lubricate the dry pills, but they finally go down, down, down the long oesophagus tube.

Jesus, kid, are you out of your mind? Yes I am, I'm a horrible person - do you hate me? You're saying some crazy fucked up stuff. What is wrong with you?

I just want to, for once in my life, be completely honest. I'm sick of toeing the line all the time.

Why are you doing this? We love you. You can't do this. You're family.

Like how she hated it when the girl took all the table space from her, or laughed in that shrill voice that rang in her ears for hours after, or kept bringing treats and sweets to share, or asked to hang out after Maths class.

How she hated herself for never really accepting the friendship offered.

She blurts out: My mom died. And I think I killed her. Did you actually put a knife in her? Smother her with a pillow? Push her off the stairs, or however she died? No. No, I didn't. She put her head in an oven, because she was ashamed of me.

Then no, you didn't kill her. Her love for you killed her. She simply couldn't bear the burden.

So if I choose to live now, is it my burden to bear?

Her nocturnal endeavours are often very forgettable. Whatever her twisted mind conjures up in sleep, it quickly vanishes with the morning sun. This time, however, she feels as though there will be no annoyingly sunny day to greet her on the other side.

So she dreams, and remembers.

She is in space, inside an astronaut's suit, floating further and further away from Earth.  A tiny rock drifts towards her, sharp and fast, and before she knew it, there was a hole in the armour.

The air is sucked out of her entire being. Out of instinct, she takes a deep breath and tries to hold it. Pop. She hears her lungs bursting. Pop. Her eyes follow. Pop. Her ear drums. The rest of her body swells up like a stretched balloon, ready to explode at any minute. She opens her mouth to scream, and she feels the saliva on her tongue burning, searing.

There is no Earth, no stars, no moon to send her off. She is loveless, worthless, soulless, but a tiny speck in this vast, expanding vacuum of space.

That calms her, somehow.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="It isn&#39;t" tags="" position="271,754.1000061035156" size="100,100">(replace: ?choice8)[==

He answers for her: "It's never too late. As long as you still care."

"Should I? Caring for people is such a burden. And it's painful when it's not returned."

"Dying might be a way out for you, but think about those who you'll leave behind."

The sky is slowly brightening. She wonders if it will be the colour of endless azure. She stands up from the bed, takes three large strides to the open window, and looks out.

Strangely enough, the stars are brighter from plain old Earth than up there, when she was floating in the vacuum, out in space.

"You're still there?"

"Yes."

"I'm only five minutes away."

"I'll be here."

She hangs up.

Outside, the sun begins to shine.

She falls to her knees on the ground as her stomach churns and twists again. From her position under the bed, she sees the empty Ambien bottle abandoned in a corner.

So that's it. She's done it. She is dying.

She breathes a sigh of relief, and closes her eyes.
